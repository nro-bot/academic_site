PaperSignals are build-it-yourself printable [robots](papersignals.withgoogle.com/) that a user
can control with their voice. This study presents an open-source browser-based user interface (written in Python) aimed at allowing users to easily customize existing Papersignal
templates. I cowrote the Flask webapp and built the physical prototypes.

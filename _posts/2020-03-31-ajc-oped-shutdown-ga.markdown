Co-wrote op-ed supported a shutdown of my home state, Georgia. I compared our state's situation to other countries such as Italy, and we explained how the economic and healthcare interests were aligned in the long run. The article was published online in the Atlanta Journal Constitution shortly before the state shutdown on April 1st.

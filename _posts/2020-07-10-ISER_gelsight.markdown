Work on a novel [Gelsight](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kimo/gelsight/) design
customized to a specific application. Gelsights are visual-tactile sensors used
to give robots a sense of touch. The Digger Finger is miniature
wedge-shaped gelsight specialized for digging in sand and other granular
media. I helped prototype the physical design as well as the initial shape
detection and annotation algorithm which used a
[YOLO-OBB](https://github.com/heshameraqi/yolo-obb-roadway-features-OLD/)
model. Featured on [MIT
News](https://news.mit.edu/2021/robotic-finger-buried-underground-0526).
